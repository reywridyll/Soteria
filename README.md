# Soteria
Soteria is a computer vision aided algorithm for marine search and rescue operations. Soteria initially started as a study for improving the range of human detection algorithms used at sea. Improvements in this aspect of human detection accelerate searching in the vastness of the ocean.

### The study proposed the following methods:

| N | Method |
|:---|:---|
|1 | Combine a HAAR cascade classifier with a blub detection algorithm optimized for detecting human heads.|
|2 | Centralised training on small target acquisition using a convolutional neural network. |

# Training
Unlike games of old, modern game engines feature realistic graphics and simulation-based physics. These features enable modern game engines the ability to simulate real-world environments with high fidelity.

Cucial data for rigorous training are obtained through the use of these modern game engines. As well as realistic environmental simulation, game engines provide a limitless amount of training data that can potentially be used to automate the retraining of detection algorithms.
